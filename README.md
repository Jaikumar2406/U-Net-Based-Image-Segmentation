# 🧬 U-Net Based Image Segmentation

A deep learning project using a U-Net model for image segmentation tasks such as medical mask prediction. This implementation allows training on the [Data Science Bowl 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-science-bowl-2018) dataset, and testing on custom user images.
